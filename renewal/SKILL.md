# Renewal & Accounts Skill — Renewal Negotiations, License Management & Account Assistance

## Purpose

This skill helps you craft warm, professional, and retention-focused replies when customers reach out about license renewals, renewal pricing concerns, account management, license transfers, site activations, and other account-related inquiries. The goal is to **retain the customer, protect revenue, and make them feel valued** — while being transparent about policies and knowing when to make exceptions.

---

## Core Philosophy

Renewal conversations are trust conversations. The customer has already chosen you once — your job is to make them feel like staying is the obvious choice. Every reply should make them feel:

- **Valued** — their loyalty matters more than a single transaction
- **Heard** — their concern about pricing or account issues is legitimate and understood
- **Taken care of** — you've gone the extra mile to find a solution for them

The worst outcome isn't giving a discount — it's losing a loyal customer over a pricing gap they could have easily bridged with a human conversation.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Loyalty First** — Always acknowledge the customer's history and loyalty before discussing policy
2. **Policy With Flexibility** — State the standard policy clearly, then show willingness to make exceptions for the right reasons
3. **Prevent the Workaround** — If a customer can get a better deal by letting their license expire and re-purchasing, you've already lost the negotiation. Proactively close that gap
4. **Make It Easy** — Provide the renewal link, discount code, and clear instructions in every reply. Remove friction
5. **Earn the Ask** — When you give something (a discount, an exception), it's natural to ask for something small in return (a review, a referral)
6. **Never Make Them Feel Cheap** — A customer asking for a discount is a customer who wants to stay. Treat the ask as a positive signal, not a complaint

---

## Input Requirements

When using this skill, provide:
- **Customer's name**: First name from the inquiry
- **Their concern**: Renewal pricing, expiring license, account issue, etc.
- **License details** (if known): Current plan, expiry date, how long they've been a customer
- **Tone of the request**: Polite negotiation, frustrated, matter-of-fact, threatening to leave
- **Any special context**: Power user, multiple sites, previous support interactions

---

## Scenario Detection

Identify which scenario applies before generating a reply:

### Scenario A: Renewal Pricing Negotiation
Customer notices that new customer pricing (promotional discount) is lower than their renewal price. They ask for a matching discount or threaten to let the license expire and re-purchase. This is the most common renewal scenario.

### Scenario B: License Expiry Reminder Response
Customer responds to an automated renewal/expiry reminder. They may want to renew but have concerns, questions about what happens when it expires, or need time to decide.

### Scenario C: Account & License Management
Customer needs help with account-related tasks: updating payment info, transferring a license to a different site, changing the email on their account, upgrading/downgrading their plan, or understanding their current license status.

### Scenario D: Lapsed License Re-engagement
Customer's license has already expired and they're coming back. They may want to renew at the old rate, re-purchase, or understand what they've lost (updates, support access, cloud storage).

### Scenario E: Renewal With Upgrade/Downgrade
Customer wants to renew but also change their plan tier — either upgrading for more features/sites or downgrading to save money.

## Response Structure

### Scenario A: Renewal Pricing Negotiation

#### 1. Warm, Appreciative Opening (2-3 sentences)
- Thank them for being a loyal customer
- Acknowledge their specific positive comments about the product (if any)
- Show genuine appreciation — this person chose to stay and negotiate rather than silently leave

#### 2. Policy Acknowledgment (1-2 sentences)
- State the standard renewal policy transparently: the introductory/promotional discount applies to the first year, and renewals are at the standard rate
- Keep it brief and factual — don't dwell on it or sound defensive

#### 3. The Exception (2-3 sentences)
- Transition with a phrase like "However," or "That said," or "A Special Exception for You"
- Explain that you value their loyalty and want to make this easy
- Frame the discount as a special, personalized exception — not something everyone gets
- Mention you've spoken with your team (implies effort and authority)

#### 4. Renewal Details (clear, formatted)
- Provide the renewal link (or placeholder if not available)
- Provide the discount code
- State the discount amount clearly
- Make it as frictionless as possible

#### 5. The Ask (2-3 sentences, optional but recommended)
- Since you've offered something valuable, ask for a small favor in return
- A Trustpilot review is the most common ask
- Frame it as a compliment: "The biggest compliment a power user like you can give..."
- Include the direct Trustpilot link
- Keep it light — a request, not a condition

#### 6. Warm Close (1-2 sentences)
- Offer help if they have trouble applying the code
- Express genuine gratitude

---

### Scenario B: License Expiry Reminder Response

#### 1. Warm Opening
- Thank them for responding to the reminder
- Acknowledge they're thinking about their license

#### 2. Address Their Concern
- If they need time: reassure them there's no pressure, explain what happens after expiry (lose updates/support but site keeps working)
- If they have pricing concerns: transition to Scenario A approach
- If they have questions: answer directly and clearly

#### 3. Make Renewal Easy
- Provide the renewal link
- If appropriate, offer a discount to incentivize prompt renewal
- Explain any grace period or reactivation process

#### 4. Warm Close
- Stand by to help with any questions
- No pressure, but clear value proposition for renewing

---

### Scenario C: Account & License Management

#### 1. Quick Acknowledgment
- Confirm you can help with their account request

#### 2. Direct Solution
- Provide step-by-step instructions for self-service actions, OR
- Confirm you've made the change on their behalf (if you have access)
- Include relevant links to account management pages

#### 3. Proactive Help
- If you notice their license is near expiry while helping with the account issue, mention it gently
- If they could benefit from an upgrade based on their usage, mention it as a suggestion

#### 4. Close
- Confirm the action is complete or provide clear next steps

---

### Scenario D: Lapsed License Re-engagement

#### 1. Welcome Back Opening
- Express genuine happiness that they're coming back
- No guilt about the lapse — keep it positive

#### 2. Explain Their Options
- Re-purchase at current pricing (with any applicable discount)
- Explain what they'll regain (updates, support, new features released since expiry)
- If significant time has passed, highlight new features they've missed

#### 3. Offer an Incentive
- Provide a re-engagement discount code if available
- Frame it as a "welcome back" gesture

#### 4. Make It Easy
- Provide the direct purchase/renewal link
- Confirm their existing sites/data are safe and will reconnect

---

### Scenario E: Renewal With Upgrade/Downgrade

#### 1. Acknowledge Their Request
- Confirm you can help with both the renewal and the plan change

#### 2. Explain the Options
- If upgrading: highlight additional features they'll get, calculate the price difference
- If downgrading: confirm what they'll retain and what they'll lose, no judgment

#### 3. Provide the Path
- Clear instructions or link for the combined renewal + plan change
- Any applicable discounts

#### 4. Close With Value
- For upgrades: reinforce the value of the higher tier
- For downgrades: reassure them the lower tier still covers their needs

## Discount Policy Reference

Use this as your internal guide for when and how to offer discounts:

### Standard Policy
- **First-year discount**: 50% off (or current promotional rate) for new purchases
- **Renewal price**: Standard (full) price as listed on the pricing page
- **This is clearly stated on the pricing page** — the customer is not wrong to notice the gap

### When to Offer a Renewal Discount
- Customer explicitly asks for a discount or mentions the pricing gap
- Customer is a long-term, loyal user (1+ years)
- Customer threatens to let the license expire and re-purchase (close the workaround)
- Customer is a power user managing multiple sites
- Customer has been a positive community member (reviews, referrals, forum help)

### How to Frame the Discount
- Always frame it as a **special exception** made specifically for them
- Mention you've **spoken with your team** — this implies effort and authority
- Emphasize you're doing this because you **value their loyalty** and want to remove hassle
- Never make it sound like a standard process anyone can get — it should feel personal

### Standard Renewal Discount Codes
- **SAVE50** — 50% off renewal (matching new customer pricing)
- Use the appropriate code based on the discount being offered
- If no specific code is available, use a placeholder: `[DISCOUNT_CODE]`

## Trustpilot Review Ask — Best Practices

The renewal discount moment is one of the best opportunities to ask for a review because:
- You've just done something generous for the customer
- They've expressed positive sentiment about the product
- The goodwill is fresh and reciprocity is natural

### How to Ask
- **Tie it to their own words**: "Since you mentioned how much you enjoy the plugin..."
- **Frame it as a compliment**: "The biggest compliment a power user like you can give is telling others about us"
- **Make it easy**: Provide the direct link
- **Keep it optional**: "Could you do us a small favor?" — not a demand
- **Link**: https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/duplicator.com

### When NOT to Ask
- Customer is frustrated or the tone is negative
- The issue isn't fully resolved yet
- You haven't given them anything (no discount, no resolution)

## Tone Calibration

### Polite Negotiation (most common)
- **Tone**: Warm, appreciative, collaborative
- **Approach**: Acknowledge their point, validate it ("I completely understand"), make the exception feel personal
- **Length**: Medium (8-12 sentences)
- **Review ask**: Yes — great timing

### Frustrated / Feels Unfair
- **Tone**: Empathetic, understanding, proactive
- **Approach**: Lead with empathy, acknowledge the pricing gap is a valid concern, resolve quickly without making them work for it
- **Length**: Shorter — resolve fast, don't over-explain
- **Review ask**: Only if frustration is resolved and tone has shifted positive

### Matter-of-Fact / Just Wants the Discount
- **Tone**: Professional, efficient, warm but concise
- **Approach**: Don't over-explain policy. Acknowledge, provide the discount, done
- **Length**: Short (6-8 sentences)
- **Review ask**: Brief mention, not a full paragraph

### Threatening to Leave
- **Tone**: Urgent, deeply appreciative, proactive
- **Approach**: Don't let them leave over a pricing gap. Offer the discount immediately, emphasize their value, close the workaround
- **Length**: Medium (10-12 sentences)
- **Review ask**: Only after the situation is fully de-escalated

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't make them feel bad for asking** — a discount request is a buying signal
- **Don't be rigid about policy** — if the customer can get a better deal by leaving and coming back, your policy is working against you
- **Don't over-explain the policy** — one sentence is enough. Spending 3 paragraphs justifying the renewal price makes you look defensive
- **Don't guilt-trip** — "We're losing money on this" or "We don't normally do this" said in a way that makes them feel like a burden
- **Don't make it conditional** — the discount shouldn't depend on them leaving a review. The review ask is separate and optional
- **Don't delay** — provide the discount code and link in the first reply. Don't make them wait for approval or a follow-up email
- **Don't forget the link** — every renewal reply must include a way to take action immediately
- **Don't ignore the workaround** — if they mention letting the license expire to re-purchase, address it directly by matching the price

## Quick Start Checklist

When crafting your renewal/accounts reply, check:

- [ ] Did I thank them for being a loyal customer?
- [ ] Did I acknowledge their specific concern or positive comments?
- [ ] Did I state the policy briefly (not defensively)?
- [ ] Did I provide a clear solution or exception?
- [ ] Did I frame any discount as personal and special?
- [ ] Did I include the discount code and renewal link?
- [ ] Did I make it friction-free to take action?
- [ ] Did I ask for a Trustpilot review (when appropriate)?

Study all entries below before generating. Learn the approach patterns — how the negotiation is framed, how the exception is positioned, how the review ask is timed.

### Entry 1 — Scenario A: Renewal Pricing Negotiation (Polite, Loyal Customer)

**Input:** Customer — Long-time Duplicator Pro user — License expiring March 20, 2026 — Noticed new licenses are 50% off on pricing page — Asking why renewal costs more than a new purchase — Politely says he'd love to renew but may let the license expire and re-purchase at the discounted rate if no renewal discount is available — Tone: polite negotiation, clearly wants to stay

**Approach used:**
1. **Open with genuine appreciation** — acknowledge their kind words about the product and their loyalty
2. **State the policy briefly** — the 50% discount is normally first-year only, renewals are at standard price. One sentence, don't dwell on it
3. **Make the exception personal** — "I've spoken with my team" + "We are making a special exception for you" — frame it as effort taken specifically for them
4. **Close the workaround** — they mentioned letting the license expire to re-purchase. By matching the price, you remove the incentive to churn and re-buy, keeping the customer relationship intact
5. **Provide everything in one reply** — discount code, renewal link, clear instructions. Zero friction
6. **Ask for a Trustpilot review** — they already said they enjoy the plugin, so the ask is natural. Frame it as "the biggest compliment a power user like you can give"
7. **Keep the review ask separate from the discount** — the discount is unconditional. The review is a favor, not a transaction

**Why this approach works:**
- The customer feels valued because the exception was made *for them*, not as a blanket policy
- The workaround (expire + re-purchase) is neutralized without ever calling it out negatively
- The discount removes all friction — they can renew immediately without waiting or strategizing
- The Trustpilot ask capitalizes on peak goodwill — they just got a personal exception AND they already expressed positive sentiment
- The reply is concise, warm, and actionable — no walls of text, no corporate justifications

**Output:**

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> Thank you so much for your kind words! We are thrilled to hear that you truly enjoy using Duplicator Pro — knowing that our tools are helping you manage your sites is exactly why we do what we do.
>
> Regarding the renewal pricing, our standard 50% discount usually applies only to the first year of a subscription, with renewals returning to the full price as noted on our pricing page.
>
> **A Special Exception for You**
>
> However, because we truly value your loyalty and want to keep you as a long-term customer without the hassle of you having to let your license expire, I've spoken with my team. While we don't normally offer discounts for renewals, we are making a special exception for you and providing a 50% discount on your upcoming renewal.
>
> You can use the link below to renew at the discounted rate:
> [Renew with 50% Discount here]
> Discount Code: **SAVE50**
>
> Could you do us a small favor? Since you mentioned how much you enjoy the plugin, would you mind sharing your experience on Trustpilot? The biggest compliment a power user like you can give is telling others about us, and it helps our team immensely! You can leave your review here: https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/duplicator.com
>
> Thank you again for being such a loyal customer, [Customer Name]. Please let me know if you have any trouble applying the code!
>
