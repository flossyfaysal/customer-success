## Case #1: Migration Follow-Up — Inactive Customer (No Sites, No Backup)

**Date:** 2026-02-19

**Category:** Migration Follow-Up

**Customer:** [Customer Name]

**Situation:**
- Customer purchased Duplicator for a migration
- Multiple follow-ups were sent with package creation instructions and share link
- Customer has not responded, has no active sites, and has not tried Duplicator yet
- White Glove Migration Service has an active 30% discount
- This is a continued follow-up (not the first contact)

**Approach:**
1. **Acknowledge the follow-up context** — reference the migration so they know why we're reaching out
2. **Observe without judging** — mention that there are no active sites yet, framed as "I noticed" not "you haven't done anything"
3. **Offer help getting started** — link to Quick Start KB so they have a self-service option
4. **Offer hands-on help** — make it clear we'll help with backup creation and migration personally
5. **Mention White Glove + discount** — position as the easy alternative, not a sales push
6. **Close with commitment** — "we're here until you succeed" framing to reinforce partnership

**Why this approach works:**
- Shifts from "why haven't you responded" to "how can we help you get started" — no pressure
- Acknowledging no activity shows we're paying attention and genuinely care about their progress
- Providing both self-service (KB link) and hands-on help gives them choices
- The White Glove mention with discount feels like a helpful suggestion, not upselling
- The closing commitment ("until your site is reliable and your work is protected") elevates the conversation from transactional to partnership

**Reply:**

Hi [Customer Name],

I'm following up on your migration — I want to make sure everything is on track for you.

I noticed you don't have any active sites set up yet and haven't had a chance to try Duplicator. No worries at all — getting started is quick, and I'm happy to walk you through it if you'd like a hand.

Here's our Quick Start guide to help you hit the ground running:
https://duplicator.com/knowledge-base-article-categories/quick-start/

If you need help creating a backup or running your migration, just let me know — that's exactly what we're here for.

And if you'd prefer to skip the technical steps entirely, our White Glove Migration Service might be a good fit. Our team can handle everything end to end — and we're still offering a **30% discount** on the service for a limited time.

We're here until you have a successful migration, reliable backups, and complete peace of mind that nothing can harm your work. Your success is our goal.

Let me know how I can help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
