# Negative Review Recovery Skill

Turn a negative customer rating into a positive experience by reaching out with empathy, acknowledging the issue, and genuinely asking how we can make things right. The goal is not just to flip the rating — it's to rebuild trust and show the customer we truly care about their experience.

---

## When to Use

- A customer left a **negative rating** on a recent support conversation
- We already took action (refund, fix, workaround) but they still rated us poorly
- There's a gap between what we did and how the customer felt about it

---

## Required Inputs

Paste the following context when using this skill:

1. **Customer name**
2. **What action was already taken** (refund, fix, plugin recommendation, etc.)
3. **Date of the action** (e.g., refund issued on Feb 12, 2026)
4. **Payment method** (PayPal, credit card, or unknown)
5. **Amount involved** (if applicable)
6. **Summary of the original conversation** (paste the previous reply or ticket summary)
7. **Any additional context** (product involved, plugin name, known issues, etc.)

---

## Response Pattern

Follow this structure when crafting the recovery message:

### 1. Warm, Personal Greeting
- Use the customer's first name
- Keep it friendly and human — not corporate

### 2. Acknowledge the Negative Rating (Without Blame)
- Mention that you noticed they left a negative rating on the last conversation
- Do NOT sound defensive or accusatory
- Frame it as: "I noticed" or "I saw" — not "You gave us a bad review"

### 3. Reference the Action Already Taken
- Summarize what was done (refund, fix, recommendation, etc.)
- Include specific details: amount, date, expected timeline
- If a refund: mention processing times based on payment method
  - **PayPal**: immediate
  - **Credit card**: 5–10 business days

### 4. Ask What Went Wrong (Genuinely)
- This is the heart of the message
- Ask open-ended questions to understand their experience
- Show that you're reaching out because you want to help, not because you want a better score
- Possible angles:
  - "Did the refund not reach your account yet?"
  - "Was there something in our response that didn't fully address your concern?"
  - "Is there anything else going on that we missed?"
  - "Did the solution we offered not work as expected?"

### 5. Express Commitment to a Better Experience
- Make it clear that their feedback matters
- Show that you genuinely want to improve
- Use partnership language — "we" and "together"

### 6. Warm, No-Pressure Closing
- Invite them to reply at their convenience
- Don't rush or pressure them
- End with a forward-looking, positive tone

## Tone & Style Rules

1. **Empathetic first, solution second** — lead with understanding, not justification
2. **Conversational and warm** — write like a real person, not a script
3. **Short sentences, easy to scan** — respect their time
4. **No guilt-tripping** — never imply they "should" change their rating
5. **No defensiveness** — don't over-explain why you were right; focus on their experience
6. **Curious, not interrogating** — ask gently, not like a checklist
7. **Confident but humble** — show you know the product, but accept you might have missed something
8. **Never mention the word "positive"** in relation to their review — don't ask them to change their rating; let the experience speak for itself

## Empathy Phrase Bank

Use these naturally — never stack multiple in one message:

**Opening acknowledgment:**
- "I noticed you left a rating on our last conversation, and I wanted to personally reach out."
- "I saw the feedback on our recent interaction, and it caught my attention."
- "Your rating on our last conversation stood out to me, and I want to make sure we didn't miss something."

**Showing you care:**
- "Your experience with us really matters, and I don't want to leave anything unresolved."
- "I want to make sure you feel fully taken care of — not just on paper, but in reality."
- "We take your feedback seriously, and I'd love the chance to understand what happened."

**Asking what went wrong:**
- "Was there something in our response that didn't sit right with you?"
- "Did we miss something that was important to you?"
- "I'd genuinely love to hear what we could have done differently."
- "Sometimes things look resolved on our end but don't feel that way on yours — and that matters to us."

**Commitment to improvement:**
- "We're always looking to get better, and your honest feedback helps us do exactly that."
- "I want to make sure this experience doesn't define how you feel about us."
- "Your satisfaction isn't just a metric for us — it's what drives everything we do."

**Closing with warmth:**
- "Take your time — I'll be right here whenever you're ready to reply."
- "No rush at all. I'm happy to help whenever works best for you."
- "Looking forward to hearing from you, and I hope we can turn this around together."

## Examples

### Example 1 — Reference Output

**Input:**
- **Customer name**: [Customer Name]
- **Action taken**: Partial refund of $149 (renewal discount applied)
- **Date**: Feb 12, 2026
- **Payment method**: Credit card
- **Original conversation**: Shared feedback about being overcharged, refund was processed, and WP Media Cleanup plugin was recommended

**Output:**

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> I noticed the negative rating you left on our last conversation, and I wanted to reach out personally to see if I can help turn things around. I genuinely want to make sure your experience with us is a positive one.
>
> I see that we processed a partial refund of $149 for you on February 12th. Since you mentioned you paid via card, it can sometimes take 5–10 business days for the bank to show that on your statement (PayPal is usually immediate).
>
> Has that refund reached your account yet? If it hasn't, or if something else went wrong during our last interaction, please let me know. We value your feedback and I'm here to make sure everything is handled correctly for you.
>
> I'm looking forward to your reply and to making this right!
>
> Best regards,
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:**
- Opens by acknowledging the rating directly — no dancing around it
- States the intent upfront: "I wanted to reach out personally to see if I can help turn things around"
- References the refund with specific details (amount, date) so the customer knows you did your homework
- Proactively mentions both payment method timelines (card vs PayPal) — helpful even if they already know
- Asks a concrete question ("Has that refund reached your account yet?") AND leaves the door open for other issues
- Closes with energy and forward momentum — "making this right!" feels confident, not desperate
- Short, scannable, and genuinely human

### Example 2 — Alternate Style (More Exploratory)

**Input:**
- **Customer name**: [Customer Name]
- **Action taken**: Partial refund of $149 (renewal discount applied)
- **Date**: Feb 12, 2026
- **Payment method**: Credit card
- **Original conversation**: Shared feedback about being overcharged, refund was processed, and WP Media Cleanup plugin was recommended

**Output:**

> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> I hope you're doing well! I noticed you left a rating on our last conversation, and I wanted to personally follow up with you.
>
> I can see that we applied a partial refund of $149 from our end on Feb 12. Since the payment was made via credit card, it can take around 5–10 business days for the refund to reflect on your statement.
>
> That said, I saw the negative rating and it made me want to check in — has the refund not appeared on your account yet? Or was there something else about the experience that didn't feel right?
>
> Sometimes we think everything is squared away on our end, but that doesn't always match how it felt on yours — and your experience is what truly matters to us. If there's anything we missed or could have handled better, I'd genuinely love to hear about it.
>
> We want to make sure you feel fully taken care of, not just today, but every time you reach out to us. Your feedback helps us get better, and I appreciate you being honest with us.
>
> Take your time — I'm here whenever you're ready to reply.
>
> Warm regards,
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:**
- Softer opening — "I hope you're doing well" warms up before the topic
- Bridges from the factual (refund details) into the emotional ("didn't feel right?")
- The line "Sometimes we think everything is squared away on our end, but that doesn't always match how it felt on yours" shows deep empathy
- More exploratory tone — invites the customer to share broadly, not just about the refund
- No-pressure close gives them space to reply on their own terms

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't ask them to change their rating** — ever. Let the improved experience do the talking.
- **Don't copy-paste this template** — personalize every response based on the actual context.
- **Don't be defensive** — "We already refunded you, so I'm not sure why..." is a dealbreaker.
- **Don't over-apologize** — one sincere acknowledgment is stronger than five hollow sorries.
- **Don't blame the system** — "Our system shows the refund was processed" sounds cold. Say it warmly.
- **Don't make assumptions** — maybe the refund arrived fine and the issue is something else entirely.
- **Don't ignore the emotional side** — a refund fixes the money problem, but not the trust problem.
- **Don't rush them** — no "Please reply ASAP" or "Can you update your rating today?"
