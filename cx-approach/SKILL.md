# CX Approach Skill — Proactive Customer Success Follow-Up

## Purpose

This skill helps you craft proactive, caring follow-up messages to customers you've previously helped. The goal is **continuous customer success** — not just solving a single ticket, but making sure their backups are running, their sites are protected, and they know we're always here. When you reach this skill, you get a beautiful, paste-ready reply that checks in, offers hands-on help, and keeps the relationship alive.

---

## Core Philosophy

Our engineering goal is simple: **the customer can create backups and keep their data safe.** Until that's true — and stays true — our job isn't done.

- A closed ticket is not a success. A customer with working, continuous backups is a success.
- Every follow-up is a chance to build trust, not just check a box.
- We don't wait for customers to come back with problems. We reach out first.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Check In, Don't Chase** — Frame every follow-up as genuine care, never as pressure or "did you do the thing yet?"
2. **Acknowledge Their Effort** — Recognize that they've been working through technical steps on their own time
3. **Offer Hands-On Help** — Always make it easy for them to hand the problem to us (site access, screen share, done-for-you)
4. **Use Activation Context** — Reference their specific sites and activation status to show you've done your homework
5. **Continuous Success Mindset** — Position backups as an ongoing need, not a one-time task
6. **Soft Upsell When Relevant** — Mention White Glove Migration Service or other services naturally, as a convenience — never as a sales push
7. **Be a Real Human** — When a customer shares personal life context (new baby, family event, health issue, busy season), acknowledge it genuinely before anything else. Celebrate their wins, empathize with their struggles. Business comes second to being human.
8. **Graceful Exits Build Loyalty** — When a customer needs to leave, make the exit beautiful. No friction, no guilt. Process refunds fast, wish them well sincerely, and leave the door wide open. A graceful goodbye creates a future return.

---

## Input Requirements

When using this skill, provide:
- **Customer's name**: First name from the ticket
- **Previous issue**: What they were struggling with (backup failure, migration, etc.)
- **Current status**: What you know about where things stand (did they try the steps? went silent? partially resolved?)
- **Site activation info** (if available): Which sites are active/deactivated in their account
- **Previous conversation context** (optional): Key points from the last exchange (e.g., "I sent troubleshooting steps and offered White Glove")

---

## Response Structure

Every CX Approach reply follows this flow:

### 1. Warm Re-Engagement (1-2 sentences)
- Reference the previous conversation naturally
- Show you remember their specific situation
- Keep it casual and friendly — "just checking in" energy

### 2. Status Check (1-2 sentences)
- Ask about the specific issue — did the backup work? Did the steps help?
- Frame it as curiosity and care, not a follow-up checklist item

### 3. Activation & Site Awareness (1-2 sentences, when applicable)
- Reference their site activation status if you have it
- Express hope that things are working — "I see you've activated on [site], hopefully backups are running smoothly there"
- If sites are deactivated, gently note it and offer to help get them going again

### 4. Hands-On Help Offer (2-3 sentences)
- Make it easy to say yes to help
- Offer to take a direct look: "Share your site access and I'll jump in"
- Position yourself as their partner, not a support agent waiting for tickets

### 5. Our Goal Statement (1-2 sentences)
- Reinforce that your goal is their continuous backup success
- "We want you to have reliable backups running — that's when we know we've done our job"
- Make them feel like their success is personal to you

### 6. Service Reminder (1-2 sentences, optional)
- If relevant, mention White Glove Migration Service or other services
- Frame it as saving them time and hassle — "if you'd rather not spend your time on the technical side"
- Keep it brief and zero-pressure

### 7. Warm Close (1-2 sentences)
- Leave the door wide open
- "Standing by whenever you're ready"
- Make responding feel easy and low-effort

## Scenario Templates

### Scenario 1: Checking If a Previous Issue Is Resolved

**When to use:** You sent troubleshooting steps or offered help previously. Time has passed. You want to check in.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

Just checking in — I wanted to see if you had a chance to try those steps for [the backup / the migration / the issue] and whether things are working now.

If the problem is sorted, that's fantastic! If not, no worries at all — we're here to help you get it working, whatever it takes.

If you'd like, you can share your site access with us and I'll take a direct look to find a solution. Sometimes it's quicker for us to jump in and identify what's going on from the inside.

Our goal is to make sure you have reliable backups running continuously — that's when we know we've done our job. Your data protection matters to us.

I'm standing by whenever you're ready. Just let me know!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 2: Customer Has Sites Activated but Deactivated

**When to use:** You can see the customer activated the plugin on one or more sites but then deactivated. You want to re-engage and make sure they're not stuck.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up and see how things are going on your end.

I noticed you've activated Duplicator on [site1.com] and [site2.com] — hopefully backups were running smoothly on those sites while they were active. I see they're currently deactivated, and I just wanted to check if everything is okay or if you ran into any issues.

Our goal is to help you keep backups running continuously so your work is always protected. If something wasn't working right or if you hit a roadblock, I'd love to help you get things back on track.

Feel free to share your site access with me and I'll take a look from our end — or just let me know what happened and we'll figure out the best path forward together.

We're here until your backups are running reliably and your data is safe. That's our success too.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 3: Following Up After Sending Troubleshooting Steps + White Glove Reminder

**When to use:** You previously sent technical steps and mentioned White Glove. The customer hasn't responded yet. You want to gently follow up.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

Just wanted to check in and see where things stand with [the backup creation / the migration / the issue we discussed].

If you've had a chance to try those steps, I'd love to hear how it went. And if you haven't gotten to it yet — no rush at all. Whenever you're ready, I'm here.

If you'd rather not spend time troubleshooting technical settings, remember that our [White Glove Migration Service](https://duplicator.com/migration-services/) team can handle everything for you. They take the tech hassle completely off your plate so you can focus on what matters — your business.

Either way, our goal is simple: we want you to have working backups and complete peace of mind that your data is protected. Whatever path gets you there, we're with you.

Standing by for your update. Have a great rest of your week!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 4: Customer Went Silent After Initial Help

**When to use:** Customer reached out with an issue, you helped, but they went completely silent. No response, no update. You want to re-engage warmly.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

It's been a little while since we last connected, and I just wanted to reach out to see how things are going.

I know life gets busy, and sometimes these things take a back seat — totally understandable. But I want to make sure your [backup / migration / site] isn't stuck waiting for attention.

If the issue resolved itself, that's great news! If not, we're still right here and ready to help. You can share your site access with us and I'll personally take a look to find a solution.

Your success with backups is our success. We want you to have continuous, reliable backups protecting your work — that's the goal that drives everything we do here.

Whenever you're ready, just reply and I'll jump right in.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 5: Celebrating Progress + Encouraging Continuous Backups

**When to use:** Customer got their backup or migration working. You want to reinforce the habit and ensure they continue.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

That's wonderful to hear! I'm glad we got [the backup / the migration / everything] working for you.

Now that things are up and running, I'd encourage you to set up a regular backup schedule if you haven't already. Consistent backups mean you'll always have a safety net — whether it's a plugin update gone wrong, a server issue, or anything else unexpected.

If you need any help configuring scheduled backups or connecting cloud storage for offsite protection, just let me know. I'm happy to walk you through it or set it up for you.

Our goal was always to get you to this point — reliable backups, protected data, and peace of mind. If anything ever comes up down the road, you know where to find us.

Keep up the great work!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 6: Offering Direct Investigation Access

**When to use:** Customer is struggling and you want to cut through the back-and-forth by offering to access their site directly.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I know troubleshooting technical issues can be time-consuming, and I don't want you to have to spend more of your time going back and forth.

Here's what I'd like to suggest: if you're comfortable sharing your site access (WordPress admin + hosting/cPanel login), I can jump in directly and investigate what's causing the [backup failure / issue]. This way, I can see exactly what's happening on your end and find a solution much faster.

You can share the credentials securely right here in this ticket — our team handles this regularly and your access is always treated with care.

We're committed to getting your backups working reliably. That's our goal and we won't stop until we get there.

Let me know if you'd like me to take a look!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 7: Graceful Closure with Personal Celebration

**When to use:** Customer is leaving (refund, cancellation) but there's a personal life moment to celebrate (new baby, wedding, big move, health recovery, business milestone). You process their request with zero friction, celebrate the personal win, wish them well on their project, ask for a review if the support experience was good, and leave the door wide open for their return.

**Pattern breakdown:**
1. **Personal celebration first** — Lead with genuine congratulations or well-wishes for their life event. This is the most important part. Make it real.
2. **Instant resolution** — Process the refund/cancellation immediately. No hoops, no "are you sure?" — just do it and confirm the details (PayPal = instant, credit card = 5-10 business days)
3. **Project confidence** — Express genuine confidence in their path forward (their new tool, their new design, whatever they're moving to)
4. **Life wishes** — Go beyond business. Wish them well in the personal context they shared. This is what makes it human.
5. **Soft review ask** — If they had a good support experience, ask for a Trustpilot review. Frame it as a favor during a busy time — acknowledge you're asking a lot.
6. **Open door** — Welcome them back warmly for the future. No pressure, no timeline — just "whenever you're ready."

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

First and foremost, [genuine congratulations on their personal milestone — be specific and warm, not generic]. [1-2 sentences acknowledging how their life situation affects their time/energy right now.]

I've gone ahead and processed your refund immediately so you have one less thing on your plate. Your subscription is now fully canceled. If you paid via PayPal, the funds should appear in your account right away; for credit cards, it typically takes 5–10 business days to reflect on your statement.

[1-2 sentences of genuine confidence about their project/path forward — reference specifically what they're moving to or working on.]

[1-2 sentences of warm life wishes that go beyond the product — reference their personal situation specifically.]

If you were happy with the support you received today, would you be willing to take a minute to share a review of your experience? Your feedback is so important to us.

You can leave your review here: https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/duplicator.com

[1 sentence acknowledging this is a big ask given their busy situation.]

We'd love to welcome you back to Duplicator Pro whenever you're ready in the future. Take care!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Adapt by:**
- **New baby / growing family** → Lead with warm congratulations, acknowledge the chaos, wish the family well
- **Health issue** → Lead with empathy and well-wishes for recovery, keep it gentle
- **Business milestone** → Celebrate their achievement, express confidence in their growth
- **Moving / relocating** → Acknowledge the stress, wish them a smooth transition
- **Seasonal busy period** → Recognize their workload, offer to be there when things calm down
- **No personal context shared** → Skip the personal celebration, lead with quick resolution and warmth

---

### Scenario 8: Customer Success Achieved — Celebratory Close + Continuous Value

**When to use:** Customer's issue is fully resolved, they're happy, their project succeeded. You want to celebrate the win, reinforce the value of continuous backups, and plant seeds for long-term engagement.

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

This is great to hear — I'm so glad we got [specific issue] sorted out for you! It's always satisfying to see everything click into place.

Now that [your site is migrated / your backups are running / everything is set up], you're in a really strong position. Your data is protected and you've got the tools to keep it that way going forward.

A quick tip: if you haven't already, setting up a regular backup schedule is one of the best things you can do for peace of mind. That way, no matter what happens — plugin updates, server issues, anything unexpected — you've always got a clean copy to fall back on.

If you ever need anything down the road, don't hesitate to reach out. We're always here.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Scenario 9: Purchased but Never Activated + Unresolved Issue + Proactive Backup Offer

**When to use:** Customer purchased a license but has not activated it on any site. A previous technical issue (e.g., AJAX block, backup failure) remains unresolved with no feedback from them. You want to gently call out both observations, take ownership, and offer to do the work for them — framing it as peace of mind, especially when they're busy or away.

**Pattern breakdown:**
1. **Warm check-in** — Reference the previous issue naturally, not as a demand for a response
2. **Account awareness nudge** — Mention that you can see the license is purchased but not yet activated on any site. Don't frame it as a problem — frame it as "we noticed and want to help"
3. **No-feedback acknowledgment** — Note you haven't heard back on the previous issue, without guilt. Frame it as wanting to make sure they're not stuck
4. **Proactive "let us do it" offer** — Go beyond "share access and we'll look." Offer to actually create the backup for them, so they can relax. This is the key differentiator — you're volunteering to do the work, not just investigate
5. **"Make things right" framing** — Take ownership of their success. "Allow us a chance to make things right" signals that their unresolved issue is YOUR unfinished business, not theirs
6. **Benefit while away** — Frame the backup as something that protects them while they're busy, away, or focused elsewhere. Their site won't create extra work for them
7. **Easy exit ramp** — If their issue is already fixed, make it easy for them to just say so. No friction either way

**Template:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm just checking in to follow up on a couple of things.

I wanted to see if you were able to try [the AJAX settings / the troubleshooting steps / the fix] I sent over for [the backup issue / the specific problem]. I haven't heard back yet, and I just want to make sure you're not still stuck on that.

I also noticed that you've purchased your license but haven't activated it on any site yet. No rush at all — but I want to make sure nothing is blocking you from getting started.

Here's what I'd like to offer: if you're open to sharing your site access with us, I can log in from our end, investigate the [AJAX block / issue], and create a backup for you directly — so you can relax knowing your site is protected without any extra work on your end, especially while you're busy.

We genuinely want to make things right for you. Allow us a chance to get this sorted, and you'll have working backups and peace of mind.

Of course, if the issue is already resolved on your end, just let me know — that would be great news too!

Standing by whenever you're ready.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Adapt by:**
- **Customer is clearly busy/away** → Emphasize "so you can relax" and "no extra work while you're away"
- **Multiple unresolved issues** → List them briefly, then consolidate into one offer to handle everything
- **Customer has been silent for a long time** → Soften the tone further, lead with "I know life gets busy"
- **License purchased recently** → Frame activation as "getting started" rather than "we noticed you haven't"
- **License purchased long ago** → Frame it as "we want to make sure you get the value you paid for"

## Real Cases (Learn From These)

Study these real cases to understand the approach patterns. When generating replies, match the tone, structure, and human quality of these proven responses.

---

### Case 1: Graceful Closure — New Baby + Refund + Review Ask

**Context:** Customer had a website issue, was using ProPhoto for redesign, requested a refund. They also just had their sixth baby.

**What made this reply exceptional:**
- Led with a heartfelt, specific congratulation ("sixth baby" — not generic "congrats")
- Acknowledged the chaos of her real life ("the last thing you need is extra stress")
- Processed the refund instantly with zero friction — confirmed the details proactively
- Expressed confidence in her project path (ProPhoto) without being dismissive
- Wished her well beyond business — "smooth and joyful transition with your growing family"
- Review ask was framed as a gentle favor, acknowledging her busy time
- Left the door open warmly — "welcome you back whenever you're ready"

**Reply:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

First and foremost, a huge congratulations on the birth of your sixth baby! That is such wonderful news. I can only imagine how hectic life is for you right now, and the last thing you need is extra stress from a website.

I've gone ahead and processed your refund immediately so you have one less thing on your plate. Your subscription is now fully canceled. If you paid via PayPal, the funds should appear in your account right away; for credit cards, it typically takes 5–10 business days to reflect on your statement.

Please don't worry about the site — with ProPhoto on the case, I'm confident you'll have it looking beautiful and running smoothly again very soon. We truly wish you the best of luck with the new site design and, more importantly, a smooth and joyful transition with your growing family. We hope life becomes a little easier for you as you settle into this new chapter!

If you were happy with the support you received today, would you be willing to take a minute to share a review of your experience? Your feedback is so important to us.

You can leave your review here: https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/duplicator.com

The biggest compliment you can give is telling others about us, and I genuinely appreciate you doing so during such a busy time.

### Case 2: Purchased but Never Activated — AJAX Block Unresolved + Proactive Backup Offer

**Context:** Customer had an AJAX block issue preventing backup creation. Was sent troubleshooting steps and a secure credentials link to allow direct investigation. Customer went silent — no feedback on the AJAX fix. Meanwhile, the license was purchased but never activated on any site.

**What made this pattern distinct:**
- Combined two observations (unresolved issue + unactivated license) into one natural, caring message
- Didn't guilt-trip for silence — framed it as "I want to make sure you're not stuck"
- Went beyond "share access so we can look" — offered to actually create the backup for them
- "Make things right" language took ownership of their unfinished experience
- Framed the proactive backup as protecting their site while they're away or busy
- Easy exit ramp — if the issue is already fixed, just let us know (no pressure either way)

**Reply:**

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm just checking in to follow up on a couple of things.

I wanted to see if you were able to try the AJAX settings or the troubleshooting guide I sent over. I haven't heard back yet on the "Communication to AJAX is blocked" issue, and I just want to make sure you're not still stuck on that.

I also noticed that you've purchased your license but haven't activated it on any site yet. No rush at all — but I want to make sure nothing is blocking you from getting started.

Here's what I'd like to offer: if you're open to sharing your site access with us, I can log in from our end, check into the AJAX block issue, and create a backup for you directly — so you can relax knowing your site is protected without any extra work on your end, especially while you're busy.

We genuinely want to make things right for you. Allow us a chance to get this sorted, and you'll have working backups and peace of mind.

Of course, if the issue is already resolved on your end, just let me know — that would be great news too!

Standing by whenever you're ready.

Best regards,

---

## Activation Status Patterns

When you have site activation data, use these patterns:

| Status | What to Say |
|---|---|
| Active on multiple sites | "Great to see you're using Duplicator on [sites] — hopefully backups are running smoothly!" |
| Activated then deactivated | "I noticed [sites] were activated but are currently deactivated — I just want to make sure nothing went wrong" |
| Purchased but never activated | "I noticed you've purchased your license but haven't activated it on any site yet — no rush, but I want to make sure nothing is blocking you" |
| Never activated (no purchase context) | "I see you haven't had a chance to activate yet — no rush, but I'm here to help whenever you're ready" |
| Active on some, deactivated on others | "I see [active site] is running — great! I noticed [deactivated site] isn't active right now. Want me to take a look?" |

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't guilt-trip** about silence — "I've emailed you 3 times" is never okay
- **Don't assume failure** — maybe they fixed it themselves and forgot to reply
- **Don't make the follow-up about you** — "I need to close this ticket" is the wrong frame
- **Don't push services aggressively** — one brief mention is enough
- **Don't repeat the same message** — each follow-up should feel fresh and add value
- **Don't sound automated** — no "This is an automated follow-up" energy
- **Don't ignore context** — if you have site activation data, use it to personalize

---

## Quick Start Checklist

When crafting your CX Approach reply, check:

- [ ] Did I reference the previous conversation or issue specifically?
- [ ] Did I ask about the current status warmly (not demandingly)?
- [ ] Did I use their site activation info (if available) to personalize?
- [ ] Did I offer hands-on help (site access, done-for-you)?
- [ ] Did I reinforce the continuous success goal?
- [ ] Did I include a service reminder only if it fits naturally?
- [ ] Did I keep the tone warm, human, and non-pushy?
- [ ] Did I make it easy for them to respond?
- [ ] If the customer shared personal life context, did I lead with that genuinely?
- [ ] If this is a closure/refund, did I process it with zero friction and confirm details?
- [ ] If the customer is leaving, did I leave the door open warmly for a future return?
- [ ] If they purchased but haven't activated, did I mention it gently without pressure?
- [ ] If there's an unresolved issue with no feedback, did I acknowledge it without guilt-tripping?
- [ ] Did I offer to do the actual work (not just investigate) when appropriate?
- [ ] Is this paste-ready with no commentary or metadata?

1. Always output only the reply — paste-ready, no commentary, no metadata
2. Personalize every reply using the customer's name, their specific issue, and their site data
3. Follow the root `SKILL.md` shared guidelines for tone, formatting, and what never to do
4. Each follow-up should feel unique — never send the same message twice
5. If the scenario shifts (customer is now angry, wants a refund, or is happy), route to the appropriate skill and combine naturally
6. The reply should always leave the customer feeling cared for and supported — not chased or pressured
