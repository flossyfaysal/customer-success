# Prevent Churn Skill

## Purpose
This skill helps you craft empathetic, solution-focused responses when customers request refunds or express frustration with your products/services. The goal is to retain customers by addressing their concerns genuinely, offering concrete solutions, and rebuilding trust.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Acknowledge First, Solve Second**: Always validate the customer's frustration before jumping to solutions
2. **Offer Concrete Help**: Provide specific, actionable solutions (not vague promises)
3. **Partnership Language**: Use "we," "us," and "together" to emphasize collaboration
4. **Safety Net**: Always offer the refund as a backup if solutions don't work
5. **Personal Touch**: Write as a human who genuinely cares, not as corporate script

---

## Input Requirements

When using this skill, you'll need:
- **Customer's complaint/refund request**: The exact issue they're facing
- **Product/service context**: What they were trying to use (backup, migration, plugin, etc.)
- **Frustration level** (optional): Low, Medium, High - helps calibrate response tone
- **Previous attempts** (optional): What the customer has already tried

### 4. Partnership Statement (1-2 sentences)

## Example Complete Responses

### Example 1: Backup Failure (Medium Frustration)

**Customer Context**: "I've tried 3 times to back up our site but it keeps failing. I need to request a refund."

**Response**:

Hi there,

I am so sorry to hear that you've run into trouble creating your backups. I know how frustrating it is to feel like you've tried everything only to have the process fail—especially when you just want the peace of mind that your data is safe.

Before we move forward with the refund, I would truly love the opportunity to make this right for you. Usually, when a backup fails, it's down to a specific server configuration, a memory limit, or a timeout setting that just needs a little adjustment to get moving.

I am confident that we can solve this for you. Here is what I'd like to offer:

* **Free Investigation**: If you can share your backup log with me, I can identify exactly where the server is hitting a wall.
* **A "Done-For-You" Backup**: If you're open to it, I would love to log in and personally create the backup for you.
* **Free Migration**: Once I've secured that backup, I'm happy to offer you a free migration at no cost to ensure your site gets to its destination perfectly.

Your success is our success, and I want to make sure you have a secure backup in your hands. Even if you don't use us for every project, I'd love the chance to prove that we can make this work for you this time—and the next time backup creation is on us as well.

Please allow us one chance to jump in and make this happen on your website. If we still can't get it working to your satisfaction, I will process that refund immediately, no questions asked.

What do you think? I'm standing by to help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Example 2: Migration Failed (High Frustration)

**Customer Context**: "This is the second migration that's failed. My site is broken and I've wasted hours on this. I want my money back NOW."

**Response**:

Hi there,

I am truly sorry for what you've been through. Having two migrations fail is completely unacceptable, and I can only imagine how stressful and frustrating this has been—especially seeing your site in a broken state. You have every right to be upset, and I take full responsibility for this experience.

Before I process your refund, I want to personally ask for one chance to make this right. I know you've already given us chances, but here's what's different this time: I'm taking ownership of this personally, and I won't stop until your site is working perfectly.

Migration failures typically happen due to database encoding issues, server compatibility problems, or DNS propagation delays—technical issues that are absolutely solvable with the right approach.

Here's my commitment to you:

* **Immediate Emergency Support**: I will personally handle your migration myself, today. Not a ticket, not a queue—me, directly.
* **Complete Site Restoration**: If anything is broken, I will fix it. Permalinks, images, databases, design—everything will work exactly as it did before.
* **Extended Premium Support**: After we get you migrated successfully, you'll have 30 days of priority support—any issue, any time, I'm here.
* **Full Refund + Free Service**: If you're still not satisfied after I've completed the migration successfully, I'll refund you in full AND you can keep the service active for 3 months at no cost. Zero risk to you.

Your success is our success, and right now, you haven't had success—which means I haven't done my job. I'm standing by right now to jump in and turn this around for you. Until your site is running perfectly, I am with you every step of the way.

Please give me your permission to fix this immediately. If I can't deliver, the refund is yours with my apologies—no questions, no delays.

I'm here and ready whenever you are.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Example 3: Plugin Not Working (Low Frustration)

**Customer Context**: "The plugin isn't doing what I expected. Can I get a refund?"

**Response**:

Hi there,

I'm sorry to hear the plugin isn't meeting your expectations. I'd really like to understand what you were hoping it would do and see if we can bridge that gap for you.

Sometimes a quick configuration tweak or a different workflow can make all the difference. Before we move to a refund, would you be open to a brief session where I can help you set it up to do exactly what you need?

Here's what I'd like to offer:

* **Quick Configuration Call**: I can walk you through the setup and make sure it's configured for your specific use case.
* **Custom Workaround**: If the feature you need isn't directly available, I can often suggest a combination of settings or a workflow that achieves the same result.
* **Direct Developer Access**: If there's a feature gap, I'll escalate this to our development team and can get you early access to upcoming features.

I'm confident we can make this work for you, but if we can't, the refund is absolutely available. I just want to make sure we've explored all options first.

Let me know if you'd like to give it one more try together. I'm here to help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
